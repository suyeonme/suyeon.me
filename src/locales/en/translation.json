      "2": "I am interested in React and Javascript. In development, I have a passion for minimalism which allows to build simple UI and write intuitive but simple code. Simple UI enables users more accessible and easily consume a service and  intuitive code makes easier cooperating between developers. I believe, a professional developer is a person who can solve complex things, translate them in an easy way so that everyone can grasp that, and is good at communication with coworkers.  To be a better developer, I constantly try to educate and push myself.",
