Simple UI makes users more accessible and easily consume a service, and  intuitive code makes cooperate easier between developers. I believe, a professional developer is a person who can solve complex things and translate them in an easy way so that everyone can grasp that and  also good at communication to enable comfortable and smooth collaboration between coworkers.  To be a better developer, I try constantly educating and pushing myself.",
